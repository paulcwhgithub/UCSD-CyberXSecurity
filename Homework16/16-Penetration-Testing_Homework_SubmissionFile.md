- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine:
  - **nmap -sV 192.168.0.10**
 
- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`:

- Zenmap vulnerability script command: 

- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:
  1. What is the vulnerability:
    - **Message signing disabled**

  2. Why is it dangerous:
    - **SMB signing allows the recipient of SMB packets to confirm their authenticity and helps prevent man in the middle attacks against SMB.**
